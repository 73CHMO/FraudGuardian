## DATA
Unlabeled data in various contexts, including videos, audio recordings, and financial transactions, is used to identify patterns and anomalies.

Detected data is stored for future analysis. In financial analysis and fraud detection, 
biometrics extract features from financial records for comparison with known legitimate and fraudulent activities,
but concerns exist about potential errors.

Research from organizations like NIST shows advanced AI algorithms have reduced error rates to 0.08%,
a significant improvement since 2014 when rates reached 4.1%.

 However, accuracy varies by application, with financial analysis achieving high rates, up to 99.97% on standardized tests,
but real-world complexities can affect accuracy,
emphasizing the need for ongoing AI algorithm improvement in financial analysis and fraud detection.
