## Problem definition
## what is the problem

In the realm of finance, characterized by swift technological transactions, the challenges of accurate 
financial analysis and the persistent specter of fraud pose significant hurdles. Traditional methods of 
financial analysis struggle to cope with the complexities of modern financial systems, while evolving 
fraudulent tactics demand a proactive response. For the past years, most financial aid institution have 
been paying double the funds. This is due to non-existing students and underserving students. First case 
is that the university has 100 000 students who are in need of financial aid (NSFAS) funding. Instead of 
sending the correct list to financial aid (NSFAS), the university sends 200 000. This means the NSFAS 
ends up using double the funds monthly paying for non-existing students or undeserving students. There 
is a high rate of crime in the financial aid institutions. For example, NSFAS found that it lost R5bn by 
funding over 40 000 undeserving applicants between 2018 and 2021 (NSFAS Annual Report). Those 
funds have not been recovered today. The problems are perpetrators using fake identity numbers and 
the system not picking the funding is for the undeserving applicants. This form of financial fraud can be 
likened to an electronic heist, with perpetrators utilizing tactics such as cloning or skimming of students' 
identity numbers. In some instances, fraudsters go to the extent of creating fake identity numbers to 
apply for financial assistance, effectively robbing these financial aid institutions. For uninformed 
institutions, it is difficult to detect. Fraudsters in our problem is the students using fake ids or university 
management sending the wrong list deliberately. As we know that funding comes from the NSFAS to the 
university and the university pay students. In addition, another critical problem is slow responsiveness 
when it comes to fraudulent activities. For example if people collect funds from the institution using 
fake identity numbers, the institution may take years without knowing anything due to human error or 
wrongfully inputting the data. Financial Agencies are drowning in data, collecting terabytes of it each 
day. AI and ML’s primary use is data management, specifically making large amounts of data searchable, 
filterable and retrievable in real-time.

## AI Solution for Financial Analysis and Fraud Detection
                              How will this AI benefit the communities, which are the financial aid institutions?

                              Benefits of Implementing Financial Analysis and Fraud Detection AI in Financial Institutions

When we look at the high crime or fraud rate in our community, it is clear that we still lack when it 
comes to responsiveness and alerting institutions when in fraud activities, so our AI model will help our 
community reduce the number of crimes.

1. Improved Financial Aid Distribution:
 
 Ensures that financial aid goes to deserving students who are genuinely in need, helping them pursue 
their education without unnecessary delays or financial hardships. This model is going to reduce the 
chances of financial aid funds being wasted on ineligible or fraudulent recipients, ultimately making the 
system more equitable.

2. Enhanced Financial Security:
   
Protects the institution's (NSFAS) financial resources by proactively identifying and preventing 
fraudulent activities, thus safeguarding the institution's funds. Increases the institution's financial 
stability, which can lead to better long-term planning and allocation of resources. This will be beneficial 
and advantageous to eligible students.

3. Timely Intervention:
   
Detects fraudulent activities in real-time or near real time, enabling universities to take immediate 
action, recover funds, and prevent further losses. Avoids situations where fraudulent activities go 
undetected for extended periods, minimizing the overall financial impact.

4. Enhanced Reputation and Trust:

Demonstrates the institution's commitment to financial transparency and responsible stewardship of 
funds, which can enhance the institution's reputation and build trust within the community. In the 
recent years, the stats showed that more people would rather choose to apply for other bursaries than 
NSFAS because most lost the trust in it. You apply for NSFAS it rejects you and it takes an identity 
number, which does not exist and funds it. Our model is going to help to attracts more qualified and 
deserving students who feel confident that the financial aid system is fair and secure.

5. Cost Savings:
   
Reduces the financial losses associated with fraud, potentially saving universities significant sums of 
money over time.

                                                        


## Machine Learning Approach

How Machine Learning Is Used in Financial Analysis and Fraud Detection.

We have trained our model to help analyze, and flag the personal details that are mostly used to commit this 
kind of fraud, which is mostly the identity numbers. By identifying identity numbers originality, Our AI 
model can flag suspicious applications or transactions in real time. Our AI model can learn and adapt to 
evolving fraud patterns. It can recognize new trends in fraudulent identity number usage, helping the 
financial institution (NSFAS) to stay ahead of fraudsters' tactics

The machine learning algorithms we used are Supervised and Unsupervised

For the Supervised algorithm, we used a set of labeled data. The dataset includes names, surnames, 
identity numbers and application numbers etc.

First, we created a training dataset, with this dataset the model can analyze, create and spot the 
relationship between the factors and predict things. The major thing it uses is comparison. Our model is 
going to compare the data received from the university with the stored data from the student’s 
application. When students apply for financial aid, the institution store their data.

Therefore, our model is going to compare the two set of data to check if whether the student does belong to the university. 
That is financial aid (NSFAS) vs Student. The second one is comparing the universities sets of application 
list and we are going to store the Home Affairs datasets in our model so that it be able to check for the 
originality of the identity numbers. That is financial aid (NSFAS) vs the university.
Supervised Machine Learning Techniques we used are

Classification:
1. Data Labeling: Label your historical dataset of financial aid applications as either legitimate or 
fraudulent based on known cases.
2. Feature Engineering: Select relevant features (such as identity numbers, application details, etc.) that 
can help the model distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent applications.
We also used the student Eligibility method where our model is going to use classification to determine 
if a student is eligible for financial aid based on their application details. This can help ensure that aid 
goes to deserving students

Regression:
1. Data Preparation: Collect data on students' financial situations, academic performance, and other 
relevant factors that affect aid amounts.
2. Feature Selection: Choose features that are strongly correlated with aid amounts, such as family 
income, number of dependents, academic performance, etc.
