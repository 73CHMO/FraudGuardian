Title: Overstated Student Enrollment for Financial Aid (University and NSFAS Fraud)
Background:

In South Africa, the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) provides financial aid to 
academically deserving but financially disadvantaged students. The University of Limpopo is 
one of the institutions participating in the program. To ensure deserving students receive 
financial aid, NSFAS and the university must coordinate the enrollment of eligible students 
accurately. However, there is a potential fraud problem in which the university might attempt 
to overstate the number of eligible students, leading to excessive disbursement of funds.
Fraud Scenario:

Student Application to NSFAS:
1. Students apply to NSFAS for financial aid, providing their personal information, including 
names, surnames, IDs, address, and other relevant details.
2. NSFAS receives and stores the student information in its database.


 Student Application to the University:
1. Students also apply for admission to the University of Limpopo.
2. The university accepts students for admission and stores their information, including 
names, surnames, IDs, addresses, and other personal details.


Coordination between University and NSFAS:
1. The University of Limpopo identifies a significant number of students who are struggling 
financially and require financial assistance.
2. The university must send a list of eligible students to NSFAS to facilitate the disbursement of 
funds to the needy students.


Fraudulent Act:
1. In an attempt to secure additional funding, the university sends a list of 30,000 students 
to NSFAS, even though they only have 20,000 eligible students in need of financial aid.
2. This fraudulent act results in an overstatement of the number of eligible students, 
leading to the disbursement of financial aid for 10,000 non-existent students.


Fraud Detection System:
The proposed fraud detection system(Fraud-Guardian) aims to identify and prevent this 
fraudulent act by comparing and analyzing the student information provided by the university 
and NSFAS:
Fraud-Guardian System Operation:

Data Collection and Storage:
The university collects student information for admission.
NSFAS collects student information for financial aid applications.


Data Analysis and Comparison:
The fraud detection system periodically compares the student information stored by the 
university and NSFAS.
It identifies inconsistencies in the number of eligible students between the two datasets.


Alert Generation:
If the system detects an inconsistency where the university claims more eligible students than 
NSFAS has in its records, it triggers an alert.


Verification Process:
Upon receiving an alert, NSFAS initiates a verification process.
NSFAS cross-references its records with the university's list to identify discrepancies and 
confirm the actual number of eligible students.


Resolution:

If fraudulent activity is confirmed, NSFAS takes appropriate legal and administrative actions 
against the university.
To strengthen the fraud detection system and ensure its effectiveness in identifying and 
preventing fraudulent activities related to student enrollment for financial aid, the following 
enhancements and additional measures can be implemented:
1. Identity Number Validation:
In addition to comparing the number of students, the system can flag identity numbers (IDs) for 
originality.
This is a crucial step since most fraudsters creating ghost students might generate fake IDs.
The system can cross-reference the ID numbers provided by the university with national 
databases or official records to verify their authenticity.
2. Address Verification:
Addresses provided by students can be another point of validation.
The system can check whether the addresses submitted by the university match those provided 
by students in their financial aid applications.
Discrepancies can trigger alerts for further investigation.
3. Incorporating Biometric Data:
To further enhance security, biometric data, such as fingerprints or facial recognition, can be 
used.
During the admission process at the university, students' biometric data can be collected and 
securely stored.
This biometric data can be shared with NSFAS for verification, ensuring that the same 
individuals are applying for admission and financial aid.
4. Real-Time Monitoring:
The fraud detection system can be designed for real-time monitoring of data.
It can continuously compare student information as it is collected and updated by the university 
and NSFAS.
Real-time alerts can be generated for any discrepancies, allowing for immediate action.
5. Auditing and Random Sampling:
Periodic audits can be conducted on a random sample of students' records.
This can help identify any inconsistencies or fraudulent activities that might not be immediately 
apparent through automated checks.
Auditing can serve as a deterrent to potential fraudsters within the university.
Compliance with data protection regulations is essential to protect students' personal 
information.
